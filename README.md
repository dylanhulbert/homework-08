## dylanhulbert.github.io/homework-08
I created the contents of this repo as homework for my Bootcamp at UofO
### Homework 08: Template Engine - Employee Summary
* Jest
* Inquirer
* Node.js
* NPM/Dependencies
* Modules
* Switch statements and constructors
### Additional notes/lessons learned
Used Jest (and the supplied test data) to create/validate the internal modules, and the provided Bootstrap templates to create the output.  Realised/learned that .gitignore exists locally to ignore pushing certain files, not remotely to stop from accepting files... so, had to delete the node_modules from my local repo, push, then add the .gitignore file and re-add the files locally and push again.  Now I know.
